<p>The Argentinian studio QB9 has published PlayEnglish, an educative adventure game that helps players both to learn English and develop their language skills while playing with their Sony® PSP.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’m writing because we want to share with you the cheerfulness of having made the game PlayEnglish&nbsp;using Blender and Gimp for the characters. At the time of the pre-production part of the team who knew Blender,&nbsp;proposed it as a tool for the production of characters because of its speed and efficiency. The good thing is we could break&nbsp;many taboos. And so we wanted to share with the community.</p>
<p>The game is to learn English, as a semi-adventure game, it has a variety of cartoon-style characters. It was released in Spain a few weeks ago.&nbsp;With all that mess we just have recently put the screenshots on the web.</p></blockquote>
