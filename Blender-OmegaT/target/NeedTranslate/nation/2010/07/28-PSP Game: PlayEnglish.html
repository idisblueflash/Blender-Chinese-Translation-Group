<p>The Argentinian studio QB9 has published PlayEnglish, an educative adventure game that helps players both to learn English and develop their language skills while playing with their Sony® PSP.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’m writing because we want to share with you the cheerfulness of having made the game PlayEnglish&nbsp;using Blender and Gimp for the characters. 前期的工作时，一部分Blender的组员推荐采用Blender作为人物制作的工具，因为Blender很高效。The good thing is we could break&nbsp;many taboos. 于是我们希望能与社区分享我们的经验。</p>
<p>The game is to learn English, as a semi-adventure game, it has a variety of cartoon-style characters. It was released in Spain a few weeks ago.&nbsp;With all that mess we just have recently put the screenshots on the web.</p></blockquote>
