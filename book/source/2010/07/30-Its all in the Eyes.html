    <p><b><u>Eyes</u></b></p>

    <p><font size="-1">Creating a character is one thing but creating
    a character in 3d that has depth is another. In life, the eye
    is a window to the soul. Eyes show inner thought because they
    have depth to them. At some level we read the eye ball without
    even knowing how or why certain looks evoke an emotion. We can
    compare this to body language. We can tell when a human is feeling
    sad by looking at their "pose" and the way they move
    slowly and kind of careless. But we can further more tell that
    they are sad by the way their eyes look and move. The eyes of
    this sad subject may be more wet because of tears and their movement
    may be slowed, maybe even timid. Also the eyes will kind of stare
    at something symbolizing a more focused inner thought. Believe
    it or not this is all common sense, your mind knows all of these
    things. However you may have never thought about it consciously.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">As 3d artists we have the ability to create
    photo real images. In that case we must pay great attention to
    detail when it comes to relating the thought, or emotion that
    we're trying to convey to our audience. One way to do this is
    to pay great attention to the eye ball. The most simplest form
    is a texture map on a sphere. In some small cases this is enough
    such as background extras, or characters that will be shaded
    in a special way etc. (click </font><b><a href="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/fathead.jpg">here</a></b><font size="-1"> for an example of a sphere and texture map eye created
    by me) However I tend to subscribe to the Pixar's belief that
    the eye needs a lot of attention in order to convey life. To
    me, a lifeless eye can ruin an image. An artist can model a photo
    realistic head in 3d but it will look lifeless if the eyes lacks
    depth.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">So how do we create depth? Well like i sad,
    a sphere with texture map works for some scenes especially if
    its a more cartoony or stylized character, and its even better
    if there's a bump map as well. However looking at Pixar's "A
    Bugs Life, we see a lot of depth in the eyeball. From this we
    can assume that they didn't use a simple sphere with a texture
    map. In fact this suggests they've modeled the eye more physically
    correct. Now I'm no surgeon so I'm not going to chart out the
    entire structure of an eye. I'm an artist so I'll fake it. That's
    what we do. One thing to remember is that if it looks good...
    its good enough.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">Before we look at the eye. When I set out
    to figure out how to make a better eye for my characters i thought
    about dolls and the way their eyes were shaped and how they looked.
    You may find that this eye reminds you of older style dolls.</font></p>

    <p><b><u>Lets look at the eye</u></b></p>

    <p></p><center><b><u><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eye01.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="315" width="359" align="BOTTOM"></u></b></center><p></p>

    <p></p><center>&nbsp;</center><p></p>

    <p><font size="-1">Here's the eye. This eye is more of a "Pixar'ish"
    kind of eye in that its clean looking. Additional texture maps
    can make this eye more photo real, such as a pinkish map with
    some small vein like lines. I like the Pixar look so that's the
    inspiration for this eye and its shaders.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">How real this eye looks depends on 3 factors:
    the actual geometry, shaders, and lighting. First we'll examine
    the geometry...</font></p>

    <p><b><u>Geometry</u></b></p>

    <p></p><center><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eye_wire01.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="252" width="300" align="BOTTOM"> <img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eye_wire02.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="245" width="270" align="BOTTOM"></center><p></p>

    <p></p><center><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eye_parts02.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="293" width="479" align="BOTTOM"></center><p></p>

    <p><font size="-1">The eye is modeled in 4 parts. They are:</font></p>

    <ul>
      <li><font size="-1">The actual circular structure of the eye
      white</font>
      </li><li><font size="-1">Pupil</font>
      </li><li><font size="-1">Cornea</font>
      </li><li><font size="-1">Iris</font>
    </li></ul>

    <p><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eye_parts03.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="270" width="400" align="BOTTOM"></p>

    <p><font size="-1">Each of these 4 parts are modeled individually.
    As you can see I've modeled the eye ball more physically correct
    in that the iris (the color of the eye) bends inward. This is
    very important to properly simulate the highlight and diffuse
    illumination that the iris has in real life. This angle allows
    the iris to literally catch light.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">The Pupil is a simple flat black 2d circle
    that sits in the iris.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">The Cornea is a key component to the eye.
    It allows us to catch sharp highlights and it gives the eye depth.
    Actually the combination of the cornea, iris and pupil are what
    give the appearance of depth but without the cornea this eye
    would look flat. The cornea is transparent and has a light reflection
    map. Its main purpose is to catch a sharp highlight</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">So far our example as been a polygon object.
    The same thing can be accomplished just fine in b-spline patch
    surfaces and nurbs. Lets look out a regular b-spline patch version
    of the eye made in 3dsmax (not a nurbs version)</font></p>

    <p></p><center><font size="-1"><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eye_patch01.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="287" width="400" align="BOTTOM"></font></center><p></p>

    <p></p><center><font size="-1"><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eye_patch02.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="322" width="400" align="BOTTOM"></font></center><p></p>

    <p></p><center><font size="-1">As you can see the same thing is easily
    accomplished. Its just a different surface type. I prefer this
    surface type because it is very resolution independent. The polygon
    version is a meshsmooth object so i can acheive higher detail
    levels with the polygon one. The patch one allows me to tesselate
    down to a very small amount of polys, thus increasing viewport
    speed when animating interactivly.<img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eye_patch04.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="303" width="400" align="BOTTOM"></font></center><p></p>

    <p></p><center><font size="-1"><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eye_patch03.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="249" width="400" align="BOTTOM"></font></center><p></p>

    <p><font size="-1">Above you can see that i've turned down the
    patch surface tesselation parameters to 5. this allows realtime
    interactivity while retaining the ability the eyeballs perfectly
    smooth with a higher tesselation value. So if i was doing film
    res stuff... i could easily turn up the step setting so that
    my eyes dont have any poly facets in them.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">The Good and Bad of patch eye ball surfaces.</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i><u><font size="-1">GOOD:</font></u></i></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1">Resolution independent</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1">Fast interactivity</font>
      </li></ul>
      <p><i><u><font size="-1">BAD:</font></u></i></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1">Doesnt work well with FFD's unless you have
        a lot of patch crossections. Mesh objects have no problem with
        FFD lattices</font>
        </li><li><font size="-1">Max has mapping issues with patches in r3
        that prevent propper mapping of patches. The only way to get
        around this is to meshselect above the patch modifier and then
        map it as a polygon. This works fine as a work around but its
        not a desired work flow.</font>
      </li></ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p><font size="-1">Now that we've examined the geometry. We must
    look further into what makes the eye more real such as lighting.
    The key to lighting the eye properly is partially in the structure
    but shaders are just as important.</font></p>

    <p></p><center><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eyes01.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="450" width="600" align="BOTTOM"></center><p></p>

    <p><b><u>The Shaders</u></b></p>

    <p><font size="-1">Shaders and lighting go hand in hand, so in
    order for the eye to light properly we need to have proper shaders.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">Each part of the eye contains a separate shader.
    There are 4 shaders in all.</font></p>

    <ul>
      <li><b><i>The Eye White shader</i></b>
      <ul>
        <dl>
          <dt><font size="-1"><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eyewhite_shader.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="161" width="160" align="BOTTOM"></font>
          </dt><dt><font size="-1">The eye white shader simulates a fresnel
          like reflection where the reflection is more visible around the
          sides of the object and is less visible head on (although it
          doesn't look like it, there's is). It has a very high specularity
          value in order to create a sharp specular reflection.</font>
        </dt></dl>
      </ul>
      </li><li><b><i>Pupil shader</i></b>
      <ul>
        <dl>
          <dt><font size="-1"><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/pupil_shader.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="158" width="160" align="BOTTOM"></font>
          </dt><dt><font size="-1">The pupil shader is very simple. Its a flat
          black color. There is no specularity or shininess settings. It
          doesn't have an ambient value either. This way it will be black
          when</font>
          </dt><dt><font size="-1">responding to light.</font>
          </dt><dt>&nbsp;
        </dt></dl>
      </ul>
      </li><li><b><i>Iris shader</i></b>
      <ul>
        <dl>
          <dt><i><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/iris_shader.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="162" width="160" align="BOTTOM"></i>
          </dt><dt><font size="-1">The iris shader has a texture map for color.
          The specular color is a map as well so it lights in a realistic
          manner. The specular settings are set in a way that you get a
          wide highlight but not a sharp one.</font>
          </dt><dt>&nbsp;
        </dt></dl>
      </ul>
      </li><li><b><i>Cornea shader</i></b>
      <ul>
        <dl>
          <dt><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/cornea_shader.jpg" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="162" width="160" align="BOTTOM">
          </dt><dt><font size="-1">The cornea shader is almost completely transparent.
          It has the same specular and shininess settings that the eye
          white shader has. It also has the same frensel reflection of
          the eye white shader. This is because they should appear to be
          all one structure and the highlights and reflections need to
          behave the same on both surfaces.</font>
        </dt></dl>
      </ul>
    </li></ul>

    <p><b><u>Other things to consider</u></b></p>

    <p><font size="-1">This is very important. If you are using a
    shadow maps you need to tell the cornea object to not cast a
    shadow and to not receive them. Its transparent anyway so its
    ok that it doesn't cast a shadow. If you don't do this the cornea
    will black out the iris and you wont see the inner eye at all.
    If you are using ray tracing i suppose you don't have to worry.</font></p>

    <p><b><u>Lighting the Eye</u></b></p>

    <p><font size="-1">Modeling the eye is only a part of creating
    the illusion of depth. Lighting is the final touch. One must
    always have at least 1 specular highlight in the eyes. You can
    usually do this in most rendering software by defining a light
    source that only effects the eyeballs and further more this light
    source should only cast specular light. In other words this light
    will only effect the specularity of the eyeballs. In 3D-Studio
    Max you can easily do this by creating a light source and toggling
    the diffuse check box off, in the light source parameters. And
    don't forget to do "INCLUDE the eyeball objects only"
    in the light sources exclude/include parameter box</font></p>

    <p><b><u>Animating the Eyeballs</u></b></p>

    <p></p><center><font size="-1">Animating the eye is fairly simple.
    If your in 3D-Studio Max i suggest using the tape measure helper
    to animate the eye. A very good friend of mine and animation
    partner, Boris Ustaev came up with this. Its actually a lot better
    than using the Look at controller in Max. If you're a Maya user,
    just go ahead and aim constraint the eyes to a null. I suggest
    constraining each eyeball to its own null, and then constrain
    those 2 nulls to one. That way you have the ability to animate
    each eye separately if you need to.</font><b><u><img src="http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eye_wire03.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" border="0" height="244" width="400" align="BOTTOM"></u></b></center><p></p>

    <p></p><center><font size="-1">If you'd like to dilate the pupils
    you can setup a linked xform in Max. This linked xform would
    be assigned to the vertecies around the inner edge of the iris.
    You will need to assign the vertecies around the outer part of
    the pupil as well to a linked xform. And then create a dummy
    in the middle of the pupil, and use that dummy to control both
    linked xform modifiers.</font></center><p></p>

      in the images are a different version of the eye but it uses
      a similar concept. The brown eye used in this example is a more
      detailed version. And its shaders are more refined.)</font></i></p>
